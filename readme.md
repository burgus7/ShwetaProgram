# Shweta Program
## Honestly idk what to call this. I'll try to find out some day what this type of program is really called

This program takes in a string of space-separated numbers, with the final being the number to sum them all up to with some combination of operations, and then attempts all those combinations until it finds one that will sum all the numbers up to equal that last number.

To run: `python3 ShwetaProgram.py`

Boring Sample input: `1 2 3 4 5 15`

Boring Sample output: `1+2+3+4+5=15`

Exciting Sample input: `14 2 7 3 9 10`

Exciting Sample output: `14*2/7-3+9=10`
